# Wikipedia race AI

This project aims to be an AI which could play the [Wikipedia race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game).
It has all the methods to parse the data from Wikipedia as well as model training and playing the game.

This project have been heavily inspired by the following content:

- [Wikipedia Data Science: Working with the Worldâ€™s Largest Encyclopedia](https://towardsdatascience.com/wikipedia-data-science-working-with-the-worlds-largest-encyclopedia-c08efbac5f5c)
- [Word Embedding: Word2Vec With Genism, NLTK, and t-SNE Visualization](https://medium.com/swlh/word-embedding-word2vec-with-genism-nltk-and-t-sne-visualization-43eae8ab3e2e)
- [An AI for the Wikipedia Game - Stanford University](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2015/309_report.pdf)
